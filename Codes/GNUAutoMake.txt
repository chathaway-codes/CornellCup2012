To make the GNU automake system to work, you will need to create:
A configure.ac file the one in QtTesting.tar.gz
  Incluces a depedency on Qt
A Makefile.am file the one in QtTest.tar.gz 
  And one in each directory with sources, like src/Makefile.am in that archive)

You also need to make sure the following files exist: AUTHORS NEWS README ChangeLog
  These can be touched via; touch AUTHORS NEWS README ChangeLog
Then run the following commands

aclocal
autoconf
automake --add-missing

Now when you hand out a tarball of your program, all the user needs to do is run...

./configure
make
sudo make install
